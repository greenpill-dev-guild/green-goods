# Pooling Rehearsal Follow-ups — W3-G Commitment acts record their sends

## Lane

- Execution sub-lane: `w3g_commitment_send_record` (machine lane `state_api`)
- Branch: `fix/commitment-send-record`, from a fresh `origin/develop` after W3-A merges; it runs
  before W3-B because it touches no visual rule (§ 1 row 49)
- Depends on: `w3a_members_act`
- Merge: `--merge` on green CI and resolved bot threads
- Class: critical (the shared JobQueue module and its commitment executor)
- Linear child: `status.json` → `execution_sub_lanes.w3g_commitment_send_record.linear.issue`
- Decision: § 1 rows 48 and 49

## Scope

N41. Every commitment act that sends a call (`claim`, `evidence`, `workLink`, `confirmation`)
records its send the way work and decisions do, settles a recorded send instead of sending it
again, and takes Discard from that record. The two creations keep their `submittedTxHash` path.

## What the code does today (read 2026-09-26 at `4615608d9`)

- `modules/job-queue/queue-policy.ts`: `SEND_RECORDS` lists `work` and `approval` only.
  `hasRecordedSend`, `writeSendCheckpoint` and `sendCheckpointOf` follow that table, and
  `isDiscardableJob` (`job-recovery.ts`) refuses only a synced job and a job with a recorded send,
  a retained broadcast or a `submittedTxHash`.
- `modules/work/send-with-checkpoint.ts` is the one place the protocol lives: an intent
  (`broadcastPending`, `broadcastPendingAt`) just before the call can reach the network, then the
  broadcast reference and the transaction. Its result is `sent`, `reverted`, `not-sent` (intent
  cleared) or `may-have-sent` (record kept).
- `modules/job-queue/approval-executor.ts` is a complete adopter: `settleRecordedSend` reconciles a
  recorded hash (`reconcileWorkTransaction`) or a UserOperation (`sender.reconcileBroadcast`) and
  hands a stranded intent to `settleStrandedDecisionIntent`.
- `modules/work/stranded-intent.ts` settles an intent no receipt can: it looks the send up from two
  minutes on, at most every five, and reopens it (`StrandedSendReopened`, waiting reason
  `send-intent-expired`) once the absence is confirmed thirty minutes after the send.
  `resolveStrandedSend` is module-private.
- `modules/job-queue/job-executors.ts`: `executeCommitmentQueueJob` builds the call and awaits
  `sender.sendContractCall` with no callbacks, so no reference is recorded or retained.
- `modules/commitment-pooling/job-executor.ts`: `executeCommitmentJob` reads the chain before
  sending for `commitmentSeries`, `commitment`, `workLink` and `evidence`. A `claim` and a
  `confirmation` have no such read.
- `modules/job-queue/process-job.ts` already treats a recorded send as sent. It skips the
  explicit-send hold, does not end the job on attempts, and turns a later failure into the
  `awaiting-confirmation` wait.
- `hooks/commitment-pooling/useCommitmentJobs.ts` documents the gap ("A commitment job records no
  broadcast checkpoint"). `useCommitmentQueueState.ts` passes each pending act to
  `isDiscardableJob`, which finds no record, so the queued-act row from W3-A offers Discard after a
  send that may have broadcast.

## Steps

1. **The record.** Add the four act kinds to `SEND_RECORDS` with the field `sendCheckpoint`. Check
   first that admission's re-enqueue identity ignores that field: the work-link comment in
   `executeCommitmentQueueJob` warns that a mutable payload field can make a legitimate re-enqueue
   look like a conflict. If it does not, keep the record out of the identity rather than moving it.
2. **The send.** Send through `sendWithCheckpoint` in `executeCommitmentQueueJob`, with a `record`
   that writes the original job (not the execution copy) and persists it. A revert clears the
   record and fails the attempt. `not-sent` keeps today's behavior, so a declined wallet tap is
   still discarded by `sendFromTap`. `may-have-sent` throws `AwaitingWorkConfirmation`.
3. **The settle.** Before sending, settle a recorded send: a hash by its receipt, a UserOperation
   through `reconcileBroadcast`, and a stranded intent through a commitment lookup in
   `stranded-intent.ts` (export or generalize `resolveStrandedSend`). The lookup reuses the
   executor's chain reads and adds the missing ones for a claim and a confirmation, for example the
   commitment's claimant or the reader's pending request, and the reader's recorded confirmation.
4. **The copy.** The queued-act row names `awaiting-confirmation` and `send-intent-expired` in en,
   es and pt. Send Now on a row that waits for confirmation checks the chain; it does not send.
5. **The notes.** Update the `useCommitmentJobs` comment and the residual note in the W3-A handoff.

A partial version is worse than none. A send on record with no settle path would be sent again on
every run, and `process-job.ts` would never end it on attempts.

## Tests (RED first)

- An executor or seam test: a claim whose receipt wait fails keeps a recorded hash, is not
  discardable, and its next run settles it without a second send.
- A stranded claim intent reopens after the grace window when the lookup confirms the absence, and
  completes when the lookup finds the claim.
- A declined prompt leaves no record, so the act stays discardable.
- `useCommitmentQueueState`: a recorded send marks the pending act not discardable.

## Rendered proof

Storybook: the queued-act row's two new waiting states, labelled. The authenticated walk is not
required for this lane; it rides the recorded call with W3-A's cases.

## Validation

```bash
bun run --filter @green-goods/shared test -- src/__tests__/modules src/__tests__/hooks/commitment-pooling
bun run --cwd packages/shared typecheck -- --scope full
bun run check --plan -- --intent push
node scripts/dev/ci-local.js --intent push --test-path shared:src/__tests__/modules/job-queue.seam.test.ts
```

The critical plan keeps its full override, and the `shared-job-queue-construction` seam is
re-certified if its fingerprint moves. Adjust the test paths to the files that exist.

## Out of scope

The creations' `submittedTxHash` path; the claim-context findings N42 and N43; Safe transactions
that collect signatures for days.

## Unblock evidence

RED and GREEN recorded; PR merged; sub-lane `completed`; Linear child Done.

## Validation Receipt

Pending.
