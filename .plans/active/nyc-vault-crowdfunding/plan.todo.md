# NYC Vault Crowdfunding Plan

**Feature Slug**: `nyc-vault-crowdfunding`
**Stage**: `active`
**Status**: `ACTIVE - corrected around dedicated /vaults crowdfunding route; implementation not started`
**Created**: `2026-05-09T21:35:46.781Z`
**Last Updated**: `2026-06-01T02:30:08Z`

## Decision Log

| # | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Primary surface is `/vaults`. | The attached Octant brief scopes a dedicated vault crowdfunding route; the prior `/fund` framing was wrong. |
| 2 | `/fund` is reuse context only. | Existing Garden funding should not be redesigned; only Card Endow capability may be reused there later. |
| 3 | Wallet-last flow is required. | Contributors should browse and choose an amount before wallet connection. |
| 4 | Octant V2 Ethereum vaults are the integration target. | Green Goods Arbitrum contracts are context/proof, not Octant's deployed Ethereum infrastructure. |
| 5 | Wallet Endow and Thirdweb Card Endow are demo scope. | Card Endow is sprint-critical after custody/share/withdrawal/provider proof, not just reusable-skill work. |
| 6 | Public Donate and Card Donate are deferred. | The NYC sprint is vault endowment crowdfunding, not Donate/Card Donate. |
| 7 | Card Endow requires user-owned receiver custody. | Vault shares must belong to the user/recovered wallet, not a provider-owned account. |
| 8 | Public management/withdrawal proof belongs to the vault route. | Card Endow cannot be visible until users can see and manage owned positions from the public vault flow. |
| 9 | Contracts lane is `n/a` by default. | Existing Octant V2 vaults are targets; no new Solidity/deployment/indexer work is planned unless proven necessary. |
| 10 | Reusable skill starts after demo validation. | The skill/scaffold is an output of the validated prototype, not a blocker for the first `/vaults` demo. |
| 11 | Linear is a mirror/check-in surface. | `.plans` remains execution truth; Linear keeps durable issue state and check-in visibility. |

## Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Lane | Planned Step | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Dedicated public `/vaults` route exists for NYC Octant vault crowdfunding. | `ui` | Build the route scaffold, campaign list/detail states, and route-local receipt/manage states. | ⏳ |
| Users can browse campaigns without wallet connection. | `ui` | Render campaign cards and details from a manifest before wallet provider gating. | ⏳ |
| Campaigns explain project, recipient logic, funding purpose, and onchain context. | `ui`, `state_api` | Define campaign/vault manifest fields and render plain-language plus onchain metadata. | ⏳ |
| Users choose vault and amount before connecting. | `ui` | Reuse/adapt amount-first funding primitives for wallet-last confirmation. | ⏳ |
| Wallet Endow deposits into the selected Octant V2 Ethereum vault. | `ui`, `state_api` | Wire deposit confirmation with connected wallet receiver semantics for both NYC vaults. | ⏳ |
| Thirdweb Card Endow works after proof gates. | `state_api`, `ui` | Build recovered-wallet receiver checkout, share verification, public manage/withdraw proof, and exact provider verification. | ⏳ |
| Card Endow cannot create provider-owned custody. | `state_api` | Require `receiverAddress`, verify resulting shares for that receiver, and keep Card Endow hidden until proof passes. | ⏳ |
| `/fund` is not the route being implemented. | `ui`, `state_api` | Keep Garden funding UI separate; only make reusable Card Endow capability compatible for later `/fund` adoption. | ⏳ |
| Donate and Card Donate remain deferred. | `ui`, `state_api` | Do not expose Donate/Card Donate in `/vaults` acceptance or provider-proof gating. | ✅ deferred |
| Green Goods Arbitrum contracts are not presented as Octant Ethereum infra. | `ui`, `contracts` | Keep copy/architecture and contracts lane clear; target Octant V2 Ethereum vaults. | ⏳ |
| Reusable skill/scaffold is planned after demo validation. | `system` | Keep skill issues linked and defer implementation until `/vaults` demo passes QA. | ✅ tracked |

## Implementation Phases

1. **Brief/scope lock + Linear sync**: correct `.plans` and Linear around the attached Octant
   crowdfunding brief, dedicated `/vaults` route, `/fund` reuse-only boundary, and deferred Donate
   scope.
2. **`/vaults` campaign route + manifest**: define the route, campaign/vault manifest shape, browse
   states, and NYC vault fixture data. **Check in after this phase.**
3. **Wallet-last Wallet Endow path**: implement browse -> amount -> connect -> confirm -> deposit for
   the two NYC Octant V2 Ethereum vaults. **Check in after this phase.**
4. **Ownership/share verification gate**: prove Wallet Endow and recovered-wallet Card Endow shares
   are owned by the user/recovered wallet and visible from the public route.
5. **Thirdweb Card Endow demo path**: implement guarded checkout/webhook/share verification with
   user-owned receiver custody and public manage/withdraw proof. **Check in after this phase.**
6. **Demo QA pass**: verify `/vaults` on desktop/mobile, wallet-last UX, Wallet Endow, Card Endow
   gates, route privacy, copy/i18n, no Donate/Card Donate, and no unrelated `/fund` redesign.
   **Check in after this phase.**
7. **Reusable skill planning handoff**: after demo validation, plan the portable Octant vault
   crowdfunding scaffold with frontend-first existing-vault UI and advanced backend/card/create-vault
   modules.

## Agent Orchestration

| Lane | Agent / Surface | Starts When | Output |
|---|---|---|---|
| UI | Claude Cloud / Claude Code | Phase 2 | `/vaults` route, campaign UI, wallet-last flow, receipt/manage states, i18n, browser proof prep |
| State / API | Codex | Phase 2, parallel with UI manifest work | shared manifest/receiver/provider types, Thirdweb checkout/webhook gates, targeted shared/agent tests |
| Contracts | Codex | Only if implementation proves a need | Normally `n/a`; no new Solidity/deploy/indexer work |
| QA pass 1 | Claude | After phases 2-5 are complete | visible UX/mobile/copy/i18n requirement review |
| QA pass 2 | Codex | After QA pass 1 | validation rerun, provider/share/receiver proof review, final plan status |
| Linear | Linear MCP / Linear agent | Every check-in | durable issue comments/state reflecting phase gate outcomes |
