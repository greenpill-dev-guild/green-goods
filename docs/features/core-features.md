# Core Features

Green Goods combines cutting-edge web3 technology with intuitive UX to create a regenerative impact platform that works for everyone—from smartphone-wielding gardeners to technically sophisticated developers.

---

## 🔐 Frictionless Onboarding (Passkey + Account Abstraction)

### The Challenge

Traditional web3 onboarding creates massive friction:
- ❌ Seed phrases are confusing and risky to manage
- ❌ Gas fees prevent participation
- ❌ Wallet setup takes 10+ minutes
- ❌ High abandonment rates (~90% for new users)

### The Green Goods Solution

**Passkey Authentication + Pimlico Smart Accounts**

**For Gardeners**:
1. Visit greengoods.app
2. Click "Sign Up with Passkey"
3. Use Face ID / Touch ID / Fingerprint
4. Done! (~30 seconds)

**Under the Hood**:
- **WebAuthn**: Industry-standard biometric authentication
- **Smart Accounts**: Kernel accounts via Pimlico
- **Gasless Transactions**: Pimlico paymaster sponsors gas
- **No Private Keys**: Secure, can't be phished

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Web2-like UX with web3 benefits
- ✅ No seed phrase management
- ✅ No gas fees for gardeners
- ✅ Familiar biometric authentication
- ✅ Works on any smartphone

**For Operators**:
- Traditional wallet connection (MetaMask, etc.)
- Full transparency and control
- Suitable for validators and admins

## 📱 PWA Experience (Mobile-First Progressive Web App)

### Why PWA?

Native apps require:
- App store approval (weeks)

- Regular updates users must install
- Platform-specific development

**Green Goods PWA**:
- ✅ Instant access via URL
- ✅ Install to home screen (optional)
- ✅ Works on iOS, Android, desktop
- ✅ Auto-updates in background
- ✅ Small install size (~5 MB)

### PWA Capabilities

**Installable**:
- Add to home screen like native app
- Runs in standalone mode (no browser chrome)
- Launch icon on device

**Offline-First**:
- Service worker caches assets
- Works without internet
- Background sync when online

**Native Features**:
- Camera access for photos
- GPS for location tracking
- Push notifications (future)
- Background sync

**Cross-Platform**:
- Single codebase for all platforms
- Consistent experience everywhere
- No app store gatekeepers

> 🔗 **Reference:** Offline caching & sync patterns mirror [TanStack Query’s offline guide](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/guides/examples/offline); revisit it before adjusting queue behaviour.

## 📸 Work Logging with MDR

**Media → Details → Review**: The signature 3-step workflow

### Why MDR?

Traditional impact forms have 15+ fields and take 30 minutes. MDR takes < 2 minutes.

**Step 1: Media** 📸
- Take before/after photos
- Capture in the field
- Stored locally if offline

**Step 2: Details** ✍️
- Select action
- Fill key metrics (< 5 fields)
- Add notes (optional)

**Step 3: Review** ✅
- Preview submission
- Confirm accuracy
- Submit

**Result**: High-quality documentation with minimal effort.

## 🤖 Automated Impact Reporting via Karma GAP

### The Problem

Impact reporting requires:
- Manual data entry across platforms
- Different standards for different funders
- Fragmented reporting systems
- Duplicate work

### Karma GAP Integration

**What Is Karma GAP?**

The Grantee Accountability Protocol (GAP) is a standardized framework for on-chain impact reporting.

**Automatic in Green Goods**:

**When Garden Created**:
```
✅ Green Goods Garden NFT minted
✅ Karma GAP Project attestation created
   → Garden becomes queryable GAP project
```

**When Operator Approves Work**:
```
✅ Green Goods Work Approval attestation
✅ Karma GAP Impact attestation
   → Work becomes verifiable GAP impact
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ **Zero extra work**: Happens automatically
- ✅ **Standardized**: Compatible with GAP ecosystem
- ✅ **Multi-chain**: Works across Arbitrum, Celo, Base
- ✅ **Transparent**: All data publicly verifiable

**For Funders**:
- Query impact via Karma GAP platform
- Standardized schema across projects
- Transparent accountability

**Supported Networks**:
- Arbitrum One (42161)
- Celo (42220)
- Base Sepolia (84532)

## 📡 Offline-First Architecture

Built for working in remote areas without reliable connectivity.

### The Problem

Conservation work happens where there's **no internet**:
- Remote forests
- Rural farms
- Mountains and valleys
- Developing regions

Traditional apps fail without connectivity.

### Green Goods Offline Capabilities

**Works Completely Offline**:
- ✅ Take photos
- ✅ Fill out forms
- ✅ Submit work (queued locally)
- ✅ View past submissions

**Automatic Sync When Online**:
- Photos upload to IPFS
- Form data prepared as attestations
- Transactions submitted
- Status updated

### Technical Architecture

**Job Queue System**:
```
User submits work offline
  ↓
Saved to IndexedDB
  ↓
Queued for processing
  ↓
When online: Upload media → Create attestation → Submit transaction
  ↓
Confirmation → Update UI
```

**Storage**:
- **IndexedDB**: Local database for queued work
- **Blob Storage**: Media files stored temporarily
- **Service Worker**: Manages background sync

**Event-Driven Updates**:
- Real-time sync status
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Graceful degradation

<!-- TODO: Add diagram showing offline architecture -->
![Offline Architecture](../.gitbook/assets/offline-architecture-diagram.png)
*Work flows from offline queue to on-chain attestation*

**User Experience**:
- 🟢 **Online**: Immediate submission
- 🔴 **Offline**: Queued, syncs later
- 🟡 **Syncing**: Background upload
- ℹ️ Clear indicators for all states
