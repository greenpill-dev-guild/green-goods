## Research & Impact

### Eight Forms of Capital

Green Goods uses a holistic framework for impact measurement:

1. **Living Capital**: Biodiversity, ecosystems
2. **Material Capital**: Physical resources
3. **Financial Capital**: Money and assets
4. **Social Capital**: Relationships, community
5. **Intellectual Capital**: Knowledge, skills
6. **Experiential Capital**: Wisdom, practices
7. **Spiritual Capital**: Meaning, purpose
8. **Cultural Capital**: Traditions, identity

**Origin**: From Ethan Roland and Gregory Landua's work in regenerative design.

**Application in Green Goods**:
- Actions tagged by relevant capitals
- Assessments measure across all capitals
- Holistic impact tracking

## User Research

### User Personas

**Gardener: Maria**
- Conservation volunteer
- Uses smartphone primarily
- Limited tech experience
- Needs simple, offline-capable tools

**Operator: David**
- Community coordinator
- Manages local restoration project
- Web3 familiar
- Needs efficient review tools

**Evaluator: Dr. Chen**
- Environmental researcher
- Needs verifiable data
- Comfortable with APIs
- Values transparency

## Design Principles

### 1. Mobile-First

**Why**: Conservation work happens in the field, not at desks.

**How**: Touch-optimized UI, camera-centric, minimal typing.

### 2. Offline-Capable

**Why**: Remote areas lack reliable connectivity.

**How**: Local-first storage, background sync, resilient design.

### 3. Simple Over Complex

**Why**: Reduce barriers to impact documentation.

**How**: MDR workflow (3 steps), clear language, guided flows.

### 4. Transparent & Verifiable

**Why**: Build trust with funders and community.

**How**: On-chain attestations, public data, open source.

### 5. Community-Governed

**Why**: Local communities know their needs best.

**How**: Operator validation, garden autonomy, no central authority.
