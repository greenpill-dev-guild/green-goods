# Why Green Goods?

Green Goods tackles three fundamental problems that hold back grassroots regenerative work from achieving its full potential.

## Problem 1: Capturing Impact Is Tedious & Meticulous

### The Current Reality

Traditional impact measurement requires:
- 📋 Complex spreadsheets with dozens of fields
- 📎 Multiple file uploads across different platforms
- 📧 Email chains with unclear submission processes
- ⏰ Hours of bureaucratic overhead per project
- 🔄 Repeated data entry across different frameworks

**Result**: Regenerative workers spend more time on paperwork than actual conservation work.

### The Green Goods Solution: Simple 3-Step MDR Workflow

Green Goods reduces this to three intuitive steps:

**1. Media** 📸
- Take before/after photos directly in the app
- Capture video documentation
- Works offline in the field

**2. Details** ✍️
- Fill in task information with clear prompts
- Add relevant metrics (trees planted, area restored, etc.)
- Provide context and feedback

**3. Review** ✅
- Preview your submission
- Confirm and submit
- Automatic IPFS storage and on-chain reference

*The MDR workflow takes less than 2 minutes per submission*

**Impact**: What used to take hours now takes minutes, letting conservationists focus on their actual work.

## Problem 2: Grassroots Work Isn't Valued & Rewarded

### The Current Reality

Conservation work at the community level often:
- 🚫 Goes unrecognized by funding organizations
- 📄 Lacks verifiable proof that satisfies grant requirements
- 💰 Receives funding **after** the work is done (if at all)
- 🤝 Struggles to build trust with potential funders
- 📊 Cannot easily demonstrate cumulative impact

**Result**: The most effective local conservation efforts remain underfunded and undervalued.

### The Green Goods Solution: On-Chain Attestations & Tokenization

Green Goods creates **permanent, verifiable proof** of every completed task:

**For Gardeners (Workers)**:
- ⛓️ **On-chain attestations**: Immutable records of your work via EAS
- 🎖️ **Digital credentials**: Build a reputation portfolio
- 🪙 **Future tokenization**: Work becomes impact tokens (via Hypercerts)
- 💎 **Retroactive funding**: Get rewarded for past work when funding arrives

**For Funders**:
- ✅ **Verifiable impact**: Cryptographic proof of work completion
- 📈 **Transparent tracking**: See exactly what their funding achieved
- 🔗 **Composable data**: Integrate with their existing frameworks
- 🤖 **Automated reporting**: Karma GAP integration for standardized reporting

<!-- <!-- TODO: Add image - Attestation Flow -->
<!-- ![Attestation Flow](../.gitbook/assets/attestation-flow.png) --> -->
*Every approved work submission becomes a permanent on-chain attestation*

**Example Attestation**:
```
Work Submission Attestation
Chain: Arbitrum One (42161)
Schema UID: 0xf6fd183baeb8ae5c5f2f27a734b546b6128bee7877ea074f5cf9b18981be3a20
Attester: Garden Account (0xa622...)
Data: 
  - actionUID: 1
  - title: "Planted 50 native trees at River Valley"
  - media: ["bafkreiemwm...", "bafkreiafya..."]
  - metadata: {"treeSpecies": "Oak", "area": "500sqm"}
```

**Impact**: Grassroots workers can finally prove their impact to the world and unlock new funding sources.

## Problem 3: Bioregions Have Many Interests, But No Coordination

### The Current Reality

Local conservation efforts are often:
- 🏝️ **Siloed**: Different groups working independently
- 🗺️ **Duplicative**: Multiple projects targeting the same areas
- 📊 **Incomparable**: Using different metrics and frameworks
- 🤝 **Disconnected**: No shared infrastructure or data
- 💰 **Competing**: Fighting for the same limited funding

**Result**: Fragmented efforts with less cumulative impact than coordinated action would achieve.

### The Green Goods Solution: Hyper-Local Impact Hubs

Green Goods **Gardens** serve as coordination hubs for bioregional work:

**What Is a Garden?**
- 🌍 **Localized community hub**: Tied to a specific bioregion
- 👥 **Multi-stakeholder**: Gardeners, operators, and evaluators
- 🪙 **Tokenized identity**: Each garden is an NFT with its own smart account
- 📊 **Shared metrics**: Unified tracking across all work
- 🎯 **Diverse actions**: Support many types of regenerative work

**How Gardens Enable Coordination**:

1. **Unified Action Registry**
   - Gardens define specific tasks relevant to their bioregion
   - All gardeners see available actions
   - No duplicate efforts

2. **Collective Impact Tracking**
   - All work aggregates to the garden level
   - Cumulative metrics show total bioregional impact
   - Transparent history for funders

3. **Local Governance**
   - Garden operators validate work quality
   - Community decides which actions to prioritize
   - Operators can be added/removed as trust evolves

4. **Shared Funding**
   - Gardens can receive grants as a collective entity
   - Impact tokens (Hypercerts) represent garden-level achievement
   - Retroactive funding rewards everyone who contributed

<!-- TODO: Add gardens coordination diagram -->
<!-- <!-- TODO: Add image - Gardens as Coordination Hubs -->
<!-- ![Gardens as Coordination Hubs](../.gitbook/assets/gardens-coordination.png) --> -->
*Gardens enable coordinated action across diverse regenerative activities*

**Real Example**: A watershed conservation garden might coordinate:
- 🌳 **Reforestation team**: Planting native species
- 🧹 **Cleanup crew**: Removing invasive plants and litter
- 📊 **Monitoring team**: Biodiversity surveys
- 🏫 **Education team**: Community workshops

All tracking progress under one shared garden, making cumulative impact visible to funders.
