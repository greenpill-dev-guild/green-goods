# Best Practices for Gardeners

Advanced tips and strategies to maximize your impact documentation quality and get faster approvals.

---

## Photo Documentation Excellence

### Before/After Mastery

**Perfect Framing**:
- Stand in exact same spot for both photos
- Use a landmark to mark your position
- Keep phone at same height/angle
- Landscape orientation for wide areas
- Portrait for tall subjects (trees)

**Timing**:
- Take "before" right before starting work
- Take "after" immediately upon completion
- Don't wait days (conditions change)
- Document progress for long projects

**Evidence Clear**:
- Show full scope of work
- Include context (surroundings)
- Make change obvious
- Avoid ambiguous photos

### Lighting & Quality

**Best Practices**:
- ✅ Natural daylight (mid-morning or late afternoon)
- ✅ Overcast days (even lighting, no harsh shadows)
- ✅ Clean camera lens
- ✅ Steady hands (or use timer)
- ✅ Multiple angles for complex work

**Avoid**:
- ❌ Direct noon sun (harsh shadows)
- ❌ Nighttime photos (poor visibility)
- ❌ Backlit subjects (silhouettes)
- ❌ Extreme close-ups only (no context)
- ❌ Blurry or out-of-focus shots

### Composition Tips

**Include for Scale**:
- Tool (shovel, rake) for reference
- Your hand or body
- Known object (water bottle, ruler)
- Multiple subjects for counting

**Show Full Context**:
- Wider shot showing area boundaries
- Nearby landmarks (buildings, trails)
- Adjacent work areas
- Geographic features

**Detail Shots** (as third photo):
- Plant species identification
- Quality of workmanship
- Specific techniques used
- Close-up of results

## Accurate Metric Reporting

### Counting & Measuring

**Physical Counting**:
- Count by hand, don't estimate
- Use tally counter for large quantities
- Group in sets of 10 for easy counting
- Double-check totals

**Area Measurement**:
- Use phone GPS apps (e.g., Measure, Google Maps)
- Pace it out (1 pace ≈ 1 meter)
- Use measuring tape for precision
- Square meters preferred (100 sqm = 10m x 10m)

**Time Tracking**:
- Note start and end times
- Include breaks if significant
- Round to nearest 15 minutes
- Be honest about effort

### Common Mistakes

**Avoid**:
- ❌ Rounding excessively (15 → "about 20")
- ❌ Estimating without basis
- ❌ Inflating numbers to impress
- ❌ Forgetting to count items

**Do Instead**:
- ✅ Count carefully
- ✅ Note if estimation (e.g., "~50 estimated")
- ✅ Be conservative if unsure
- ✅ Explain methodology in notes

### Metric Conversions

**Know Your Units**:
- 1 hectare = 10,000 sqm
- 1 acre = 4,047 sqm  
- 1 sqm = 10.76 sq ft
- 1 km = 0.62 miles

**Preferred Units**:
- Area: Square meters (sqm)
- Distance: Meters (m) or kilometers (km)
- Weight: Kilograms (kg)
- Time: Hours and minutes

## Context & Storytelling

### What to Include in Notes

**Challenges Overcome**:
- "Steep slope required extra erosion control measures"
- "Had to hand-carry tools 1km due to no vehicle access"
- "Worked around heavy rain, covered seedlings"

**Observations**:
- "Saw 3 different bird species using new nest boxes"
- "Soil quality much better than expected"
- "Local residents stopped to ask questions and express thanks"

**Collaboration**:
- "Worked with 5 community volunteers"
- "Coordinated with adjacent garden's planting schedule"
- "Local school brought 20 students to help"

**Learning & Innovation**:
- "Tried new mulching technique that saved time"
- "Learned about native species from elder"
- "Adapted approach based on previous submission feedback"

### What NOT to Include

**Avoid**:
- ❌ Complaints about other gardeners
- ❌ Irrelevant personal information
- ❌ Off-topic rambling
- ❌ Negative comments about operators/garden

**Keep It Professional**:
- Fact-based observations
- Constructive notes
- Relevant context
- Positive framing

## Action Selection Strategy

### Choose the Right Action

**Match Your Work**:
- Read action descriptions carefully
- Ensure your work meets ALL requirements
- Don't force-fit work to wrong action
- Ask operator if unsure

**Timing**:
- Check start/end dates
- Some actions are seasonal
- Priority actions may exist
- Complete time-sensitive actions first

### Diversify Your Portfolio

**Why Variety Matters**:
- Shows versatility
- Develops diverse skills
- Attracts different funders
- Keeps work interesting

**Action Types to Mix**:
- Planting/installation
- Monitoring/observation
- Maintenance/care
- Education/outreach
- Cleanup/restoration

---

## Timing & Frequency

### When to Submit

**Best Times**:
- Same day as work completed
- While details fresh in mind
- During good internet connection
- When you can ensure quality

**Avoid**:
- Weeks after work done (memory fades)
- Rushing right before deadline
- Batching unrelated work together
- Late at night when tired

### Submission Frequency

**Ideal Cadence**:
- **Regular contributors**: 2-4 submissions per week
- **Casual contributors**: 1-2 per month
- **Event-based**: After each major project

**Avoid**:
- Overwhelming operators with 10+ at once
- Long gaps (months) between submissions
- Daily submissions of tiny tasks (batch small work)

---

## Working Across Multiple Gardens

### Managing Multiple Memberships

**Organization**:
- Clearly identify which garden for each work
- Understand each garden's standards
- Build relationships with each operator team
- Track your stats per garden

**Action Differences**:
- Same work type may have different names
- Metrics requirements vary
- Standards may differ
- Respect each garden's culture

### Building Multi-Garden Reputation

**Benefits**:
- Diverse impact portfolio
- Multiple operator references
- Broader skill development
- More funding opportunities

**Strategy**:
- Start with 1-2 gardens
- Build approval rate (&gt;80%)
- Then expand to more
- Maintain quality across all

## Seasonal & Weather Considerations

### Weather Documentation

**Include in Notes**:
- Extreme conditions ("100°F heat, extra water needed")
- Unusual weather impact
- Adaptations made
- Safety considerations

**Photo Adjustments**:
- Overcast is actually ideal (even lighting)
- After rain: Shows soil condition, wetlands clearly
- Seasonal changes: Track over time with same angles

### Seasonal Work Planning

**Spring**:
- Focus on planting
- Document germination
- Install infrastructure

**Summer**:
- Maintenance and watering
- Growth monitoring
- Education events

**Fall**:
- Harvest documentation
- Seed collection
- Habitat preparation

**Winter**:
- Planning and preparation
- Indoor work (seed sorting)
- Monitoring (wildlife, dormancy)

## Efficiency Tips

### Batch Photography

**For Multiple Tasks Same Day**:
1. Take all "before" photos first
2. Complete all work
3. Take all "after" photos
4. Submit each task separately (don't combine)

### Prepare in Advance

**Before Going to Site**:
- Review action requirements
- Bring necessary tools
- Check phone battery (for photos)
- Download offline maps
- Note exact task location

### Use Templates

**Consistent Language**:
- Develop your photo naming system
- Use similar structure in notes
- Copy/adapt previous good submissions
- Save common phrases for reuse

---

## Quality Over Quantity

### Approval Rate Matters

**Better**:
- 10 submissions, 9 approved (90%)
- Shows quality work
- Builds trust with operators
- Attracts funding

**Worse**:
- 50 submissions, 25 approved (50%)
- Suggests rushed work
- Requires more operator time
- May hurt reputation

### When to Slow Down

**Red Flags**:
- Multiple recent rejections
- Feedback mentions same issues
- Approval rate dropping
- Feeling rushed or stressed

**Reset Strategy**:
1. Pause new submissions
2. Review all feedback
3. Improve one aspect at a time
4. Do 1-2 exemplary submissions
5. Rebuild approval rate
6. Then increase frequency
