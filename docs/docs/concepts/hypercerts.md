# Hypercerts & Impact Tokens (Roadmap)

**Status**: Coming Soon 🚀

Hypercerts will enable Green Goods gardens to aggregate verified work into tradable impact certificates, unlocking retroactive funding and impact markets.

---

## What Are Hypercerts?

**Hypercerts** are semi-fungible tokens that represent claims of impact work over a defined scope, time, and set of contributors.

Think of them as **certificates for impact** that can be:
- 📊 Measured and verified
- 🪙 Fractionalized and traded
- 💰 Funded retroactively
- 🔗 Composed with other impact

## How Green Goods Will Use Hypercerts

### Garden-Level Impact Certificates

Instead of funding individual work submissions, funders could purchase **garden Hypercerts** representing aggregated, verified impact:

```
Watershed Restoration Garden Q1 2024 Hypercert

Scope:
  - Water quality improvement
  - Native habitat restoration
  - Species reintroduction

Time:
  - January 1, 2024 - March 31, 2024

Work:
  - 45 approved work submissions
  - 15 active gardeners
  - 850 native plants installed
  - 2,500 sqm restored

Contributors:
  - 15 gardeners (weighted by work)
  - 3 operators (validation work)
  - 1 garden (coordination)
```

**Hypercert Value**: Determined by market + impact metrics

---

## Retroactive Funding

The Hypercert model enables **retroactive funding** — rewarding proven impact rather than funding promises.

### Traditional Grants vs. Retroactive Funding

**Traditional Model**:
```
Write proposal → Get grant → Do work → Submit report → Hope for renewal
```

Problems:
- ❌ Funding based on promises, not results
- ❌ High overhead in proposal writing
- ❌ Misaligned incentives (spend to show need)
- ❌ Rigid budgets

**Retroactive Model with Hypercerts**:
```
Do work → Verify impact → Mint Hypercert → Sell to funders
```

Benefits:
- ✅ Funding based on proven outcomes
- ✅ Low overhead (just do good work)
- ✅ Aligned incentives (max impact = max value)
- ✅ Flexible funding sources

---

## Hypercert Lifecycle in Green Goods

### 1. Accumulate Verified Work

Gardens track cumulative approved work over time:
- All work has on-chain attestations
- Operators validated quality
- Metrics aggregated to garden level

### 2. Mint Hypercert

At quarterly or annual milestones:
```
Garden mints Hypercert with:
- Scope: Conservation activities completed
- Time: Period covered (e.g., Q1 2024)
- Work: Links to all attestation UIDs
- Contributors: Weighted by contribution
```

### 3. Fractionalize

Hypercert is split into shares:
- 70% to active gardeners (weighted by approved work)
- 20% to operators (validation work)
- 10% to garden treasury (coordination)

### 4. Market Listing

Hypercert fractions can be:
- Listed on impact marketplaces
- Purchased by aligned funders
- Traded between parties
- Held for long-term value

### 5. Retroactive Funding

When funders purchase Hypercert fractions:
- Value flows to contributors
- Gardeners receive direct compensation
- Operators get validation rewards
- Garden treasury grows for future work

## Example: Watershed Garden Hypercert

**Scenario**: Watershed Restoration Garden mints Q1 2024 Hypercert

**Impact Summary**:
- 45 work submissions (all approved)
- 850 native plants installed
- 2,500 sqm habitat restored
- 12 invasive species patches removed
- 3 water quality tests (all improved)

**Fractionalization**:
```
Total Supply: 1,000 shares

Gardeners (70% = 700 shares):
  - Alice: 150 shares (most work)
  - Bob: 120 shares
  - Carol: 100 shares
  - Others: 330 shares (split proportionally)

Operators (20% = 200 shares):
  - David: 120 shares (lead operator)
  - Eve: 80 shares (co-operator)

Garden Treasury (10% = 100 shares):
  - Held for coordination costs
```

**Funding**:
1. Environmental DAO values this work at $10,000
2. Purchases 500 shares (50%) for $5,000
3. Funds distributed:
   - Alice receives: ~$750 (150/1000 of $5,000)
   - Bob receives: ~$600
   - Garden receives: ~$500
   - And so on...

**Result**: Retroactive funding for proven, verified impact!

## Impact Markets

Hypercerts enable liquid markets for regenerative work.

### Market Participants

**Buyers (Funders)**:
- Environmental DAOs
- Impact investors
- Carbon credit buyers
- Philanthropists
- Grant programs

**Sellers (Contributors)**:
- Gardens (entire Hypercerts)
- Gardeners (their shares)
- Operators (validation shares)

### Price Discovery

Hypercert value determined by:
- 📊 **Verification**: On-chain attestations
- 🌍 **Scope**: Type and scale of impact
- 👥 **Trust**: Garden/contributor reputation
- 💰 **Demand**: Funder interest
- 📈 **Outcomes**: Measured results

**Future**: Prediction markets for expected impact value

## Attribution & Contribution Tracking

Green Goods' attestation system provides **perfect attribution** for Hypercerts:

### Contribution Weighting

**For Gardeners**:
```
Weight = (Approved work count * Quality score) / Total garden work
```

**For Operators**:
```
Weight = (Reviews completed * Consistency score) / Total reviews
```

**For Garden**:
```
Weight = Fixed % for coordination overhead
```

### Example Calculation

```
Garden with 100 approved work submissions:
- Alice: 25 submissions → 25% of gardener pool
- Bob: 15 submissions → 15% of gardener pool
- Others: 60 submissions → 60% of gardener pool

If gardener pool = 70% of total Hypercert:
- Alice gets: 25% * 70% = 17.5% total
- Bob gets: 15% * 70% = 10.5% total
```

## Multi-Capital Hypercerts

Green Goods' eight forms of capital framework enables **nuanced impact claims**:

### Capital-Specific Hypercerts

Instead of generic "reforestation" Hypercert:

**Living Capital Hypercert**:
- Scope: Biodiversity improvements
- Metrics: Species count, habitat quality
- Work: Planting, monitoring, invasive removal

**Social Capital Hypercert**:
- Scope: Community engagement
- Metrics: Workshops held, participants
- Work: Education, events, coordination

**Cultural Capital Hypercert**:
- Scope: Traditional practices preserved
- Metrics: Indigenous knowledge documented
- Work: Interviews, workshops, cultural events

**Benefit**: Funders can support specific capital types aligned with their mission.
