# AI Prompt Contract — Client Surface

Stable vocabulary and never-use list for prompting AI design tools or coding agents to generate client PWA screens that align with the Green Goods garden-journal voice.

> **Companion**: The `admin` surface uses a restrained operator cockpit dialect. See [prompt-contract.md](./prompt-contract.md) for admin-specific framing. This file is client-specific — gardener-facing PWA framing.

## Stable Prompt Core

Paste this sentence (or a trimmed version) into every AI design prompt for client surfaces:

> Green Goods client is a **PWA in an adaptive shell**. Installed PWA uses a **bottom `AppBar`**; browser uses a **hamburger + `SiteHeader`**. Never mix. Use **Inter** for all typography (editorial serif only appears on the public browser site, never in the PWA). Surfaces follow the **Warm Earth** language — concentric geometry, expressive spring motion, garden-journal feel. Materials are **permitted to be expressive** (liquid glass, organic shapes, hero moments). **Real content over lorem ipsum.** Copy tone is **warm, first-person-community** — "our garden", "what's in season", "how the work grew" — not operator-facing task framing.

## Required Vocabulary

> **Canonical glossary**: cross-surface domain terms (Garden, Action, Work, Assessment, Hypercert, Vault, Cookie Jar, Attestation, Hat, Season) and personas (Gardener, Operator, Evaluator, Funder, Community Member) live in [`docs/docs/reference/glossary-community.md § Design Vocabulary`](../../../docs/docs/reference/glossary-community.md#design-vocabulary). The table below is client-specific shell / journal vocabulary that does not live there.

Use these terms when describing client UI:

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `adaptive shell` | The PWA-vs-browser shell pattern; mode determines chrome |
| `installed PWA` | Bottom navigation, app-feel, standalone mode |
| `browser mode` | Hamburger + top header, website-feel |
| `garden-journal feel` | Handmade but precise, seed-catalog aesthetic |
| `expressive material` | Liquid glass, organic shapes, spring physics permitted |
| `hero moment` | Celebrated flow (garden creation, first work, hypercert mint) |
| `value flow` | End-to-end chain visualization (submit → review → assess → fund) |
| `MDR flow` | Media + Data + Review — the core gardener capture loop |
| `pane` | Primary surface unit (not "card" — panes float, cards sit) |
| `succession-aware` | UI complexity scales with garden stage (pioneer/intermediate/climax) |
| `ecological time` | Seasonal prompts, not countdowns or streaks |
| `capability badge` | Recognition of what a user can independently do, not activity volume |

## Never Use (in client prompts)

> **Canonical source**: the full client-banned phrase list lives in [`docs/docs/reference/glossary-community.md § Client-Only Banned (AI Prompt Vocabulary)`](../../../docs/docs/reference/glossary-community.md#client-only-banned-ai-prompt-vocabulary) and in [`docs/docs/reference/banned-vocabulary.json`](../../../docs/docs/reference/banned-vocabulary.json) (`prompt_vocabulary_client_banned`). Lint-enforced cross-surface bans live in the same glossary § Lint-Enforced section — `bun run lint:vocab` parses the JSON.

The categories below are contract-specific framing — *why* client output should reject these patterns. The exact phrase set is the glossary's job:

- **Operator-cockpit framing** — `operator cockpit`, workbench / inspector vocabulary; the client is a garden journal, not a cockpit.
- **Utility-copy register** — terse task framing; client copy is warm and narrative.
- **Dashboard / KPI / metric-grid framing** — the client surfaces story and place, not key-performance-indicator tiles.
- **Admin typography** — `Plus Jakarta Sans` is admin-only; client uses Inter throughout the PWA.
- **Growth-hacking framing** — streak, leaderboard, FOMO, re-engagement, retention hook; violates the regenerative lens (also lint-enforced).
- **Trading-floor / financial-terminal framing** — degen aesthetic; this is a garden, not an exchange.
- **Gamification** — we use motivation design, not game mechanics.

## Materials & Motion (client)

- **Full Warm Earth expression** is permitted — capsule + squircle + concentric shapes, spring motion, hero moments, expressive color.
- **Glass material is allowed across client surfaces**, unlike admin where glass is restricted to Navigation/FAB and sheet shells while the admin `AppBar` root stays transparent. Match thickness to content density (see [materials.md](./materials.md)).
- **Spring motion is the default easing** — never hardcoded cubic-bezier or duration values.
- **Typography** — Inter across the PWA. Editorial serif (Fraunces/Lora/Newsreader) only on the public browser site, never in the installed PWA.
- **Succession-aware** — pioneer gardens get simple hero moments, climax gardens get full expression.

## Copy Voice

The client speaks **to the community, about the work**. The admin speaks **about the work, to the operator**. Same garden, different dialects. Cross-surface voice pillars and terminology live in the root [`DESIGN.md § Voice & Copy`](../../../DESIGN.md#voice--copy).

**Say:** "Let's see what's grown in your garden." / "Your work is in good hands." / "The reviewer will take it from here." / "Go do more of what matters."

**Don't say:** "Processing submission..." / "Review queued." / "1 of 12 pending." / "Submit another?"

### Browser mode (funders / community members)

- **Headlines** — editorial, evocative, magazine-weight. "The gardens growing a new kind of evidence."
- **Subheads** — bridge emotion and information. "Community-documented impact, verified on-chain."
- **Garden descriptions** — place-first. Lead with where the garden is and what it grows, not the technology.
- **Impact numbers** — let them breathe. "47 documented actions" > "47 actions have been documented by community members."
- **CTAs** — warm imperative. "Fund this garden" not "Contribute now."

### Installed PWA (gardeners)

- **Instructions** — direct, second-person. "Describe what you did" not "Please provide a description."
- **Labels** — short, noun-based. "Photo", "Method", "Confidence".
- **Empty states** — encouraging, suggest next action. "No work yet. Start by documenting what you see."
- **Sync status** — calm indicators. "Saved locally" / "Synced" / "Syncing…"
- **Errors** — never blame the user. "We couldn't submit that" not "Your submission failed."

## Canonical Component Palette

AI design tools MUST map generated output to these existing exports. Do not invent component names — flag missing primitives instead.

**Shell routes and components** (`packages/client/src/routes/`, `packages/client/src/components/`):

| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| `requireWebsitePresentationLoader` / `requirePwaPresentationLoader` | Presentation-mode route guards — browser stays on public routes, PWA routes to `/home` |
| `PublicShell` | Browser mode route shell — `SiteHeader` + public route outlet |
| `PwaRuntime` / `AppShell` | Installed/authenticated PWA runtime — providers, update notifier, scroll root, bottom `AppBar` |
| `SiteHeader` | Browser mode — hamburger (mobile) + horizontal links (desktop), fixed transparent header that fades out on scroll; no backdrop blur |
| `AppBar` | Installed PWA — bottom nav (Home / Garden / Profile), hides on `/home/garden` and `/home/:id/work/:workId` |
| `SyncStatusBar` | Positioned above `AppBar`, reflects offline queue state |

**Shared primitives** (import from `@green-goods/shared`):

| Family | Components |
|--------|-----------|
| Dialogs | `DialogShell` (default — mobile bottom-sheet + desktop centered, `glass-floating`) |
| Cards / status | `Card`, `StatCard`, `StatusBadge`, `Alert` |
| Feedback | `Skeleton`, `Spinner`, `HydrationFallback` |
| Input | `FileUploadField`, `ListPrimitives`, `DatePicker`, form components |
| Surfaces | `Surface`, `SyncStatusBar` |
| Identity | `AddressDisplay`, `DomainBadge` |
| Audio | `Audio/*` (voice capture primitives) |

**Typography utilities** (`packages/client/src/styles/typography.css`):
- `.title-screen` · `.title-section` · `.body-md-regular` · `.label-md`
- Compact type scale — `body-sm` and `label-md` are the workhorses.

**Hero moment amplification** (garden creation, first work submission, hypercert mint, vault deposit, seasonal transitions, assessment completion, role milestone):
- Apply full Warm Earth amplification: expressive shape × full chroma × Expressive motion scheme × display typography × dramatic material.
- Spec and list: `.claude/skills/design/language.md § Hero Moments`.
- **Never appear in admin** — see `prompt-contract.md § Hero Moments Live in the Client, Not the Cockpit`.

**Reference composition**: browser `/gardens` marketplace, PWA `/home` Work/Garden/Profile tabs. Model new client surfaces on them.

## Why This Contract Exists

The admin cockpit and client PWA speak different dialects of the same Warm Earth language. An explicit client contract prevents two failure modes:

1. **Admin bleed** — client screens generated with operator-cockpit vocabulary produce sterile data-table layouts where a garden journal belongs.
2. **Growth-hacking drift** — AI tools default to "engagement-maximizing" patterns (streaks, leaderboards, FOMO) that violate the regenerative design lens.

Created 2026-04-17 to close the asymmetry gap — admin had `prompt-contract.md`, client had nothing but the root `DESIGN.md`.
