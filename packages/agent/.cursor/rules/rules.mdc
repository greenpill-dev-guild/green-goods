# Agent Package — Core Patterns

**See `AGENTS.md`** for the primary architecture guide.

This rule file has been consolidated into `AGENTS.md` which provides:
- Quick reference and commands
- Architecture overview
- Core concepts (messages, handlers, sessions)
- Development workflows
- Anti-patterns to avoid

**Deep dive rules:**
- `architecture.mdc` — Data flow, handler context, layer patterns
- `deployment.mdc` — Railway, Docker, webhooks
- `security.mdc` — Encryption, rate limiting
- `testing.mdc` — Coverage targets, test patterns
