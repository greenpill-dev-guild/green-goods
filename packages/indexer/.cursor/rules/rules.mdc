# Indexer Rules

- Mirror contract events precisely; include work status transitions and attestation references.
- Expose queries optimized for UI screens (gardens list, pending approvals, user submissions).
- Add pagination & filters; prefer stable sort keys.
- Keep mapping functions idempotent; handle reorgs with confirmations strategy.
